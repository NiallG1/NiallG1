## 🚀 About Me

🎓 My name is Niall Garvey and I am an **Bioinformatician** specializing in writing software for a range of genomic analysis projects. I have a Bachelors in Genetics & Molecular Biology (UCD) and a Masters (NUIG) in **Computational Genomics**. 

👨‍💻 My previous projects include writing an **Infulenza analysis pipeline** for the **National Virus Laboratory UCD (NVRL)** to provide variant analysis on currently circulating strains of Influenza. I also constructed a database of all the NVRL's publications which is self updating on a monthly basis.

🎸 Outside of work, I have many hobbies that help me relax. My hobbies range from sports such as **hiking** and **Brazillian Jiu Jitsu**, to more relaxing ones such as **playing guitar** and **reading**, typically history or science fiction 📚.
